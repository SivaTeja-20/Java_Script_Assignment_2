console.log("Steve Rogers : Big man in a suit of armour. Take that off, what are you?\nTony Stark : Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.\nSteve Rogers : I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I've seen the footage.

Everything special about you came out of a bottle!\nSteve Rogers : Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.")
